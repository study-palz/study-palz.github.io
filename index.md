# Welcome to Study-Palz 👋

**A face-to-face study group platform for ICS students at UH Mānoa**

---

## 💡 Overview

ICS students often struggle to complete homework efficiently or understand material deeply—mainly because they study alone. Study-Palz helps fix that by making it easy for students to self-organize real-time, face-to-face study groups in ICSpace.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Encourage ICS students to study together in person.
- Make ICSpace a central hub for academic collaboration.
- Reward helpful behavior through game mechanics.
- Create a safe and focused space by keeping all sessions in ICSpace.

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Login & Set Up Your Profile**  
   - List the ICS courses you’ve taken (to help others).
   - Mark current courses you need help with.
   - Upload a headshot so others can recognize you.

2. **View Courses & Members**  
   - See a list of ICS courses.
   - View "Senseis" (students offering help) and "Grasshoppers" (students seeking help) per course.

3. **Create Study Sessions**  
   - Propose a study session at a set time or choose **“Right Now!”** if you need instant help.
   - Get notified when others join your session.

4. **Join Sessions & Help Others**  
   - Use the calendar to view all active and upcoming sessions.
   - Join in-person in ICSpace to collaborate and learn.
