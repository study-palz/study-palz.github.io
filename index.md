## 💡 Overview

UH students often struggle to complete homework efficiently or understand material deeply—mainly because they study alone. Study Palz helps fix that by making it easy for students to self-organize real-time, face-to-face study groups on campus.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Encourage students to study together in person.
- Leaderboard to challenge students and encourage them to study more.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Login & Set Up Your Profile**  
   - When creating your account, your major is asked to group you with students in that major.
   - Mark current courses you need help with.
   - Upload a headshot so others can recognize you.

2. **View Courses & Members**  
   - See a list of UH courses.
   - View "Senseis" (students offering help) and "Grasshoppers" (students seeking help) per course.

3. **Create Study Sessions**  
   - Propose a study session at a set time or choose **“Right Now!”** if you need instant help.
   - Get notified when others join your session.

4. **Join Sessions & Help Others**  
   - Use the calendar to view all active and upcoming sessions.

## 🏆 Game Mechanics

- Earn points and levels by participating in sessions.
- Top Senseis and Grasshoppers may earn real-world rewards (e.g., gift cards).
- Designed to prevent abuse and promote real participation.

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Admin Support

- All meetings happen on the UH Campus for student safety.
- Admins can monitor activity and step in if issues arise.
